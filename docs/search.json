We intend to read papers that appeal to the average econometric practitioner. Our goal is to read papers that are groundbreaking and seminal in the field, be it the classic GAMLSS paper from Rigby & Stasinopoulos (2005) or a recent contribution such as the Matrix Autoregressive models by Chen et al. (2020). In every session we have a 20 min presentation of a paper and then discuss the main takeaways. Afterwards, we have the tradition to go out together for dinner were the discussion takes new directions into either socializing with new people or into new research topics."
